### Project Summary: IoT-Driven Washroom Monitoring and Analytics System

The project is an advanced IoT-based washroom monitoring and analytics system designed to enhance facility management by providing detailed, real-time insights into washroom usage. Built on the ThingsBoard platform and integrated with the ChirpStack network server, this system offers a sophisticated approach to monitoring, data visualization, and reporting across multiple washrooms within a facility. Key features include:

1. **Real-Time Occupancy and Usage Monitoring**:
   - **Dynamic Occupancy Tracking**: Continuously monitors and displays the number of individuals inside each washroom, providing real-time occupancy data.
   - **Cubicle Status Visualization**: Offers immediate visibility into the status of each toilet cubicle, distinguishing between occupied and vacant cubicles with clear visual indicators.
   - **Entry and Exit Counting**: Accurately tracks the flow of people entering and exiting the washroom, allowing for precise occupancy metrics.

2. **Comprehensive Time-Based Analytics**:
   - **Total Wait Time Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total wait time for users, helping to identify peak usage periods and potential bottlenecks.
   - **Average Washroom Usage Time**: Analyzes and presents the average time users spend in the washroom, enabling better resource planning and management.
   - **Cubicle-Specific Wait Time Monitoring**: Provides detailed analytics on the wait times for each cubicle, offering insights into cubicle usage patterns.

3. **Advanced Dashboard Features**:
   - **Multi-Washroom Management**: Supports the monitoring of multiple washrooms from a centralized dashboard, facilitating efficient oversight of large facilities.
   - **Customizable Layouts**: Allows for the creation and integration of specific washroom layouts, enabling the system to reflect the actual physical layout of the facility.
   - **Device Assignment and Management**: Simplifies the assignment of specific IoT devices to corresponding washroom layouts, ensuring accurate data collection and representation.
   - **Custom Icons and Calculations**: Enhances user experience with the inclusion of customizable icons and tailored calculations, allowing for a highly personalized and informative dashboard interface.

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**:
   - **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Empowers facility managers with real-time data visualization tools, enabling immediate responses to occupancy trends and anomalies.
   - **Historical Data Analysis**: Facilitates long-term data collection and analysis, providing insights that can inform future facility design and resource allocation.
   - **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to scale with the needs of the facility, the system can be easily expanded to accommodate additional washrooms and devices.

5. **Operational Efficiency and User Experience**:
   - **Improved User Satisfaction**: By reducing wait times and optimizing washroom usage, the system contributes to a better user experience.
   - **Enhanced Facility Management**: Provides facility managers with actionable insights, enabling proactive maintenance and improved operational efficiency.

This IoT-driven washroom monitoring and analytics system represents a cutting-edge solution for facility management, combining real-time data, advanced analytics, and customizable dashboards to deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for managing washroom usage across large or complex facilities.
